ActsAsGeocodable
================

gem install yahoo-geocode --include-dependencies

./script/generate geocodable_migration add_geocodable_tables

Set the default geocoder in the bottom of your environment.rb file.

Example: 
Geocode.geocoder = Yahoo::Geocode.new 'your_api_key'

Then, in each model you want to make geocodable, add "acts_as_geocodable". For example, 

class Stores < ActiveRecord::Base
	acts_as_geocodable
end

Alternatively, you if you use the address methods below (or provide setters), you can automatically update the address fields if the geocoding process returns more accurate data

class Stores < ActiveRecord::Base
	acts_as_geocodable :normalize_address => true
end

Each Model that acts_as_geocodable needs to have a some sort of address that is referenced via the provided full_address method.  You can use any field names for you addresses, but if they are different than mine (street, city, state, zip), you will have to provide your own full_address method that concatenates them together.

def full_address
	address = ''
	address += self.street+"\n" unless self.street.blank?
	address += self.city+', ' unless self.city.blank?
	address += self.state+' ' unless self.state.blank?
	address += self.zip unless self.zip.blank?
	address
end
