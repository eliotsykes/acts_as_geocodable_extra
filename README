ActsAsGeocodable
================

gem install yahoo-geocode --include-dependencies

./script/generate geocodable_migration add_geocodable_tables

Set the default geocoder in the bottom of your environment.rb file.

Example: 
Geocode.geocoder = Yahoo::Geocode.new 'your_api_key'

Each Model that acts_as_geocodable needs to have a some sort of address.  This is always referenced via the provided full_address method.  You can use any field names for you addresses, but if they are different than mine (street, city, state, zip), you will have to provide your own full_address method that concatenates them together.

def full_address
	address = ''
	address += self.street+"\n" unless self.street.blank?
	address += self.city+', ' unless self.city.blank?
	address += self.state+' ' unless self.state.blank?
	address += self.zip unless self.zip.blank?
	address
end
